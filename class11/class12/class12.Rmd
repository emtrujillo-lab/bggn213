## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



### PDB Statistics 

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

Q: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.



```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

```{r}
stats$Total / sum(stats$Total)
```
```{r}
ans <- round(stats$Total / sum(stats$Total) * 100, 2)
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
```



Q: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
sum(stats$proteins)
```

```{r}
sum(stats$Total)
```


```{r}
sum(stats$Proteins) / sum(stats$Total) 
```

```{r}
(sum(stats$Proteins) / sum(stats$Total)) * 100
```

#need to get this to work
```{r}
round(sum(stats$Proteins) / (sum(stats$Total) * 100, 2)
```



Q: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

##load bio3d to analyse protein structure data 

use the bio3d package from CRAN

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


# More questions.  How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

Q: Name one of the two non-protein residues? HOH and MK21
 2
Q: How many protein chains are in this structure? 2

```{r}
library("bio3d")
```


```{r}
library("bio3d")

pdb <- read.pdb("1AKE")
pdb
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','4X8M_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','4X8H_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','4NP6_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

#download and parse these structures

```{r}
#download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(rgl)
```


```{r}
library(bio3d.view)
view(pdbs)
```


```{r}
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```


```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
```

```{r}

```
 

#Make a PCA trajectory
